            My name is Giang (spelled like Zhang), and I am a rising junior at Colorado College, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. 
        </p>

        <p>
            When I first arrived at the college, I didn't have an idea of what I wanted to major in. Being young, wild, and naive, I was fixated on traveling and learning a bit of everything. Due to the flexible nature of Colorado College's block plan, I took a block off to join a month-long coding challenge in California. Never in my life have I ever felt so <em>hooked</em>: because the program's language was C, I got the chance to learn about pointers, memory allocation/collection, and to solve fundamental problems without libraries. I left yearning for more!

            The experience opened a new door in my life. Coming from Vietnam -- a somewhat conservative, male-dominated country, I never thought I could be a software engineer. In my mind, I was not it: I wasn't the best kid in STEM, nor did I find myself fit the narrative of a tech-savvy person. Despite my growing doubts, I found myself lucky to have the most supportive of friends, who reassured me of my decision. At the end of my sophomore year, I finally had the gut to follow the major.

            It's been both a difficult and rewarding experience, with many late nights figuring out what went wrong.  I'm thankful for everything ðŸŒ»

            I'm looking forward to building cool things and currently looking for software engineering internship opportunities in the US. I can be reached at giangthupham [dot] 99 [at] gmail [dot] com.
